## Product Description

The Imbalance Finder for SMC is a powerful tool designed to identify potential market reversals and provide precise trade targets. By analyzing the highs and lows of three candles, the indicator calculates imbalances and detects mitigated or unmitigated imbalances in the market.

Key Features:
- Calculates imbalances based on highs and lows of three candles
- Identifies mitigated and unmitigated imbalances
- Detects potential market reversals
- Provides precise trade targets
- Optimizes code for efficient calculations and performance
- Integrates necessary trading functions
- Compatible with the L platform
- Follows coding best practices and proper documentation
- Tests code functionality and reliability

## How it Works

1. The `CalculateImbalances()` function calculates imbalances based on the high and low prices of three candles.
2. The `IdentifyImbalances()` function uses the `CalculateImbalances()` function to check for mitigated and unmitigated imbalances. It prints the result.
3. The `DetectMarketReversals()` function also uses the `CalculateImbalances()` function to check for potential market reversals. It returns `true` if a reversal is detected, otherwise `false`.
4. The `GetTradeTargets()` function calculates trade targets based on imbalances and the close price of the third candle. It returns two targets.
5. The `OptimizeCode()` function can be used to add code optimization for efficient calculations and performance.
6. The `ExecuteTrades()` function can be customized to execute trades based on the identified imbalances and trade targets.
7. The `IsLPlatformCompatible()` function can be used to check the compatibility of the code with the L platform. It returns `true` if compatible.
8. The `FollowBestPracticesAndDocumentCode()` function can be used to add coding best practices and proper documentation.
9. The `TestCode()` function can be used to test the functionality and reliability of the code.
10. The `OnStart()` function is the main entry point of the code. It calls the necessary functions in a predefined order to identify imbalances, detect reversals, execute trades, optimize code, check platform compatibility, follow best practices, and test code functionality.

Please note that this code is a sample implementation and may need to be customized and tailored to fit specific trading strategies and requirements.
